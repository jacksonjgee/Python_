Strengthening my Python skills

This summer holiday I plan to hone-in my python skills. Mastering the basics and more...

The reason I want to do this is to then learn numpy/pandas/matplotlin/scikit-learn and start creating projects next year. 

Hopefully with these skills I can have a more likely chance of getting an internship.

I will be following a roadmap similar to this: https://roadmap.sh/python

The goal is to finish this roadmap in 3 months Nov-Jan, during my holiday.

```python
print("I love Python")
```
I will be learning python from the following links in the following order:
https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python
to lock in basics and fundamentals
https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved
to lock in intuition.
