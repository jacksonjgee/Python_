Strengthening my Python skills

This summer holiday I plan to hone-in my python skills. Mastering the basics and more...

The reason I want to do this is to then learn numpy/pandas/matplotlin/scikit-learn and start creating projects next year. 

Hopefully with these skills I can have a more likely chance of getting an internship.

I will be following a roadmap similar to this: https://roadmap.sh/python

The goal is to finish this roadmap in 3 months Nov-Jan, during my holiday.
